  Project Draco continues as our free technology preview from Autodesk Research
  that makes animation as easy as sketching. The easy-to-use interface allows
  you to add a rich set of subtle, continuous animation effects to your images
  (e.g., JPGs, PNGs, GIFs) without the complications of timeline and
  key-framing.
